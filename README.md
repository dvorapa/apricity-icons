# Apricity Icons

Apricity OS icon theme for Gnome or Cinnamon

## Description

Fork of the former Apricity OS icon theme designed for Gnome or Cinnamon desktop environments. Application icons come by default as `numix-circle`, and the various symbolic and mimetype icons are a combination of `vimix`, `numix` and `paper`. Updated time to time.

## Usage

To use this icon theme on Gnome you just have to insert `Apricity Icons` folder into `~/.icons` folder (for the specified user only) or into `/usr/share/icons/` folder (for all users). Then install `gnome-tweaks` and under appearance tab choose the Apricity Icons theme.
